                                    Here is a small description of my journey as a developer. <br /> <br />
                                    I started learning Python in 2018. I was in 9th grade at that time.
                                    I didn't knew, what I was steping into. I was just curious about programming.
                                    I started learning Python and I was amazed by the power of programming.
                                    As time went by, I started learning more and more about programming.
                                    Soon I got into Game Development so started learning C# and Unity.
                                    Made quite a few games, some for Jams, some just for fun.

                                    <br /> <br />
                                    In 2020, during the lockdown, I had time to explore programming.
                                    So I did, I did various projects in various diffrent languages.
                                    I learned technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js,
                                    Express.js, MongoDB, Firebase, Python, C#, Unity, Blender, and many many more.

                                    Currently I am getting into Web Development.
                                    Web Development was my last option to learn.
                                    I always thought that Web Development is boring.
                                    But I was wrong. And I am here making this website.
