export const aboutMe = `Here is a small description of my journey as a developer.
I started learning Python in 2018. I was in 9th grade at that time.
I didn't knew, what I was steping into. I was just curious about programming.
I started learning Python and I was amazed by the power of programming.
As time went by, I started learning more and more about programming.
Soon I got into Game Development so started learning C# and Unity.
Made quite a few games, some for Jams, some just for fun.

In 2020, during the lockdown, I had time to explore programming.
So I did, I did various projects in various diffrent languages.
I learned technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js,
Express.js, MongoDB, Firebase, Python, C#, Unity, Blender, and many many more.


Currently I am getting into Web Development.
Web Development was my last option to learn.
I always thought that Web Development is boring.
But I was wrong. And I am here making this website.`;
